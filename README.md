# Heimdall

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/aodai/heimdall)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/aodai/heimdall)  
Heimdall is a project in early stage that aims to provide a modern API for Rappelz server management. At the moment Heimdall provides general information about a Rappelz server.

## TODO

- [ ] Add endpoints for executing functions on Rappelz's game server.  
- [ ] Implement users and roles.  

## Note

I'm using this project to learn Go so if you find anything I can improve or make it more Go-like please let me know!
